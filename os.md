\# Open Source Codebases

\#\#\# 1\. \[Apache Superset\](https://github.com/apache/superset)  
Apache Superset is a modern data visualization and business intelligence platform. It enables users to create interactive dashboards, charts, and graphs from a variety of data sources.It has wide range of integrations and flexible for large datasets. This project offers a deep dive into backend APIs, front-end development using JavaScript and React, and deploying data-centric applications.

\#\#\# 2\. \[MySociety FixMyStreet\](https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet)  
FixMyStreet is a platform for citizens to report problems in their area, such as potholes or broken streetlights, and direct those reports to the right local authority. It provides a highly practical and community-driven service. The codebase covers both front-end user interfaces and back-end services like geocoding and database interactions. I find this particularly relevant given my experience working on a similar cobrand project for [TWIN](http://wp.transboundarywater.tech). The potential to contribute to improving civic tech makes it a very engaging project for me to work on.

\#\#\# Why FixMyStreet Stands Out

FixMyStreetâ€™s focus on community reporting and civic engagement makes it an interesting and meaningful project. Having worked on a similar project (the TWIN cobrand for FixMyStreet), I am familiar with its architecture and have customized various aspects of the platform. This familiarity will allow me to contribute effectively and explore new challenges, such as improving the UX/UI or working on their map-based problem reporting feature. Moreover, it aligns with my long-term goal of leveraging technology for societal challenges, making it a great opportunity for me to dive deeper into civic technology.
