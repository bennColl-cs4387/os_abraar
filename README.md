# List of Solo Fixes

No solo fixes were successfully completed during this course. Instead, I focused on engaging with complex issues in FixMyStreet and LibreChat, which provided valuable learning experiences despite not resolving the issues.

**FixMyStreet: Issue #3748**  
Attempted to address warnings in the `waste.t` test output but faced dependency and environment challenges that prevented successful reproduction of the issue. [Details](https://github.com/bennColl-cs4387/os_abraar/blob/main/solo_fix/Issue%20%233748_fix_mystreet.md)

**LibreChat: Issue #1215**  
Worked on an enhancement to show token usage per conversation. Explored backend and middleware solutions but encountered implementation challenges that required more time than available. [Details](https://github.com/bennColl-cs4387/os_abraar/blob/main/solo_fix/issue1215.md)

# Group Fix

**Project: PyCaret: Issue #3011**  
Collaborated with my group to resolve an issue where PyCaret’s `ExpandingWindowSplitter` misrepresented fold numbers in time series cross-validation. My contributions included debugging, testing dynamic fold calculations, and improving user-facing display summaries. This experience underscored the importance of effective teamwork and clear communication in resolving complex issues.

# Learnings

This course has been a roller coaster experience, teaching me the nuances of contributing to open-source projects and learning about my limitations and setbacks. I have gained:

**Technical Expertise:**
- Improved skills in debugging and understanding complex dependencies, particularly through attempts in FixMyStreet and LibreChat.
- Gained insight into backend and frontend integrations while working on group and individual tasks.

**Collaboration and Communication:**
- Learned how to engage with open-source communities through GitHub issues, PRs, and discussions.
- Collaborated effectively on the PyCaret group project, contributing to a meaningful resolution.

**Problem-Solving:**
- Although unable to resolve FixMyStreet and LibreChat issues, I gained a deeper understanding of dependency management, Docker setups, and middleware complexities.

**Understanding Community Impact:**
- FixMyStreet’s potential for empowering communities through civic reporting reinforced my desire to contribute to impactful civic tech projects.

**Pain Points:**
- **Dependency Challenges:** Struggled with missing modules and incomplete setups in FixMyStreet and I am almost certain that Perl is not the language I want to work on in the future.
- **Debugging Hurdles:** Found middleware implementation in LibreChat challenging to debug and integrate effectively.

**Wish List:**
- Explore advanced debugging techniques for Perl and middleware systems.
- Gain exposure to large-scale data projects like Apache Superset to expand my knowledge base.
