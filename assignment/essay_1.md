### Languages Used:
- **Perl:** Primary language for back-end functionality, including scripting and tests.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the front-end interface.
- **SQL:** For database interactions.

### Main Contributors and Community
- **Primary Contributors:** Many of the core contributors are part of MySociety, a nonprofit organization dedicated to building digital services for civic and social good.
- **Corporate Influence:** The project is primarily supported by a nonprofit rather than a corporate entity, which aligns with open-source values and civic tech ideals.
- **Part of a Larger Foundation:** Yes, FixMyStreet is part of the mySociety project portfolio, which also includes other civic tech initiatives like TheyWorkForYou and WhatDoTheyKnow.

### Code of Conduct
- **Code of Conduct:** FixMyStreet, being part of the mySociety projects, follows a standard open-source code of conduct that emphasizes inclusivity, respect, and collaboration. This creates a welcoming environment for contributors.

### Documentation
- **Good Documentation:** The project is well-documented, with resources for setting up a development and deployment environment, contributing guidelines, and customization options. 

### Project Activity
- **Live and Active:** The project is still actively maintained, with frequent updates, bug fixes, and new features being introduced. It has an active community of developers and contributors, ensuring that issues are addressed, and progress is continually made.

## Why FixMyStreet is a Good Codebase for Me

### Relevance to Past Experience:
Having worked on a similar cobrand project for TWIN, I am familiar with the architecture of FixMyStreet and have customized various aspects of the platform. This experience means I can contribute meaningfully from the start.

### Alignment with Long-Term Goals:
My long-term goal is to leverage technology to address societal challenges, particularly through civic technology. FixMyStreet aligns perfectly with this aim, allowing me to engage in meaningful work that benefits communities.

### Opportunities for Growth:
FixMyStreet provides opportunities to deepen my skills in:
- **Perl**
- **UX/UI**
- **Map-Based Reporting Features**

## Why I Would Be a Good Contributor to FixMyStreet

### Familiarity with the Codebase:
Having already worked on a TWIN cobrand for FixMyStreet, I understand the platform's architecture and can quickly adapt to new features or fixes.

### Commitment to Community Impact:
I am motivated by projects that improve civic engagement and community well-being, which aligns with FixMyStreet's mission. This shared purpose drives my enthusiasm for contributing to the platform.

## Issue Description

The problem involves warnings appearing in the `waste.t` test output. Specifically, the warnings are related to the use of uninitialized values and non-numeric arguments in mathematical or string operations. These warnings include:
- `"Argument "" isn't numeric in addition (+)"`
- `"Use of uninitialized value in string eq"`
- `"Use of uninitialized value in split"`

### Technical Details
- **Explanation:** These warnings are indicators of potential bugs in the code, where variables may not be properly initialized before being used in operations. In this context, the warnings may not always cause visible errors. Fixing this issue will involve adding checks to ensure variables are defined and appropriately typed before use.
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Variables are being used before they are set or have meaningful values.
  - Functions or operations are expecting specific data types (like numeric or string values) but are receiving undefined or incorrect values instead.
- **Dependency on Other Issues:** This problem may depend on or be related to the initialization of variables elsewhere in the codebase. If the data is coming from other parts of the application (such as user inputs or database queries), those sources may also need to be checked for completeness and correctness.

## Community Perspective

### Split in the Community:
There has not been a split about whether the issue should be fixed, as fixing warnings can be a good practice to ensure code quality.

### Emotional Responses:
It is unlikely that this issue would cause unreasonable anger, as the warnings are relatively minor. Still, developers who are passionate about maintaining high code standards might be frustrated by recurring warnings in tests.

## Analysis of the Issue Report

- **Template Completion:** The issue report does not provide detailed information about the cause or any attempted solutions. It may be helpful if the issue report included steps to reproduce the warnings, the environment in which they occur, and any prior efforts to address the problem.
- **Attempts at a Fix:** There is no indication from the issue report that a fix has been attempted yet.

## Identifying One or More Possible Solutions

### Code Fixes:
- **Check for Uninitialized Variables:** Add checks to ensure variables are defined before using them. 
- **Proper Data Validation:** Validate incoming data (user input or database results) to ensure it is in the expected format and type before performing operations.

### Improving Tests:
- **Mock Data Handling:** Ensure the test suite initializes all data variables correctly. If tests are running without proper setup, they could be triggering the warnings by passing uninitialized values.

## Additional Considerations

### Bug Reproduction:
Since this issue was found during testing, it should be reproducible in a test environment. The problem is the template was not filled but since I have worked with this codebase before I know `./script/test t/app/controller/waste.t` will execute the test file `waste.t` located in the `t/app/controller/` directory and would likely produce the same error.

### Hardware Requirements:
There are no specific hardware requirements to address this issue. It can be tested and fixed in a typical development environment.


### Is It an Input/User/Localization Issue?
This issue is primarily a technical one, related to how the application handles data internally rather than a problem stemming from user input, localization, or language settings. However, user input or external data could be a contributing factor if the input is not adequately validated.

## Conclusion
Addressing the warnings in the `waste.t` test output is a matter of code quality and robustness. While the issue is not contentious, fixing it would help maintain a clean and reliable codebase. Possible solutions include checking for uninitialized variables, improving data validation, and refactoring the code to handle data more consistently.
