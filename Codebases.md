# Open Source Codebases

### 1. [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset)
Apache Superset is a modern data visualization and business intelligence platform. It enables users to create interactive dashboards, charts, 
and graphs from a variety of data sources. It has a **wide range of integrations** and **flexibility for large datasets**. 
I can explore:
- Backend APIs
- Front-end development using **JavaScript** and **React**
- Deploying data-centric applications

### 2. [MySociety FixMyStreet](https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet)
FixMyStreet is a platform that empowers citizens to report local issues, like potholes or broken streetlights,
 and ensures the reports reach the right authorities. It’s a **practical and community-driven service**. The codebase spans:
- Front-end interfaces for user interaction
- Back-end services, including **geocoding** and **database interactions**

Having worked on a similar cobrand project for **[TWIN](https://wp.transboundarywater.tech)**, I find this particularly relevant. 
FixMyStreet presents an engaging opportunity to contribute towards **civic tech** improvements, making it a very appealing project for me to work on.

### Why FixMyStreet Stands Out

FixMyStreet’s dedication to **community reporting** and **civic engagement** makes it a standout project.
 My prior experience working on the **[TWIN](https://wp.transboundarywater.tech)** cobrand for FixMyStreet means
 I am already familiar with its architecture and have customized multiple facets of the platform. 

This familiarity will allow me to:
- **Contribute effectively** from day one
- **Explore new challenges**, such as improving UX/UI
- Work on **map-based problem reporting features**

Additionally, it aligns with my long-term goal of using **technology to address societal challenges**, making FixMyStreet the perfect opportunity to **dive deeper into civic technology**.
